            After being turned around by the first shots, McDonald hits the ground. Puffs of smoke can be seen rising
            from his body as bullets penetrate and strike the pavement behind him. At the end of the 16-second ordeal,
            Van Dyke's partner kicks away a knife McDonald was carrying, which was the only thing that prevented Van
            Dyke from reloading his weapon.
            This is tantamount to first-degree murder, according to Cook County State's Attorney Anita Alvarez, who
            charged Van Dyke on Tuesday.

            On the dashcam video, McDonald first comes into the view while he's jogging in the middle of a southwest
            Chicago street. Van Dyke and his partner exit their police SUV, and Alvarez said that Van Dyke began firing
            six seconds later.

            Investigators could only attribute two of the 16 shots fired by Van Dyke as striking McDonald while he was
            standing. The rest — as many as 14 —struck McDonald as he lay wounded on the ground.
            After emptying a 15-round magazine plus one bullet in the chamber, Van Dyke began to reload before being
            called of by his partner, who approached McDonald and kicked the knife away.

            At a press conference before the video was released, Alvarez was asked if Van Dyke, his partner, or any of
            the other six officers on scene that night attempted to give medical aid to McDonald as he lay dying.

            "No," she said.
            The video comes after more than a year of calls for its release among police-accountability advocates and
            journalists in Chicago and across the country. If not for the efforts of independent journalist Brandon
            Smith, the footage may not have been made public. After all, the city paid McDonald's family $5 million over
            the shooting—and as part of the deal, the video would not be released.

            Even before its horrific images were shown, many feared the video would cause riots, looting, unrest and
            violent clashes with police.

            While that remains to be seen, one fact is now abundantly clear: McDonald didn’t deserve to die.

            “The young man was stopped by the first bullet,” says Lorenzo Davis, a former Chicago police commander who
            has since become a whistleblower against the Independent Police Review Authority, the agency that
            investigates all officer-involved shootings and claims of misconduct. “The other shots where an execution.”

            Davis, who served 23 years on the force and lost a partner to gunfire, said Van Dyke was not justified.

            “The officer’s reason for using deadly force was a lie,” Davis told The Daily Beast early Friday. “His and
            his partners’ lives were never in danger.”

            After the shooting, Fraternal Order of Police spokesman Pat Camden arrived to tell reporters what had
            happened in the eyes of the officers he represents.

            McDonald "lunged" at them, he said. The officers were in fear for their lives, he said. Van Dyke “discharged
            his weapon, striking the offender,” he said in anodyne cop-talk.

            Such is the language of almost all police shootings—until an autopsy occurs, or an eyewitness comes forward,
            or video evidence contradicts an officer’s statement. The first of those scenarios is what broke the
            McDonald case wide open when it was revealed that McDonald was shot 16 times, all over his body.
            Following events in Ferguson and Baltimore over police-killings, activists and community organizers in
            Chicago have been preparing for the release of the footage that was made public today in anticipation of the
            unrest that some expect will occur now that McDonald’s death is available for the world to see.

            Corey Brooks, a black pastor in Chicago’s Woodlawn neighborhood, traveled to Baltimore to meet with clergy
            and community leaders there in order to prepare for what may be an even more chaotic reaction to another
            black death at the hands of a white cop here.
